# C project template

I am literally tired of ducktaping makefiles and other configs when starting new c projects for learning and fun.
So I have made this template to include some build scripts and 'basic' code that helps me start faster. This repo will be improving over time to include
better build process for multiple platforms (windows and mac), and some custom code that I quite often repetively define.

## TODO

- [ ] i currently use makefiles for mac and build.bat for windows i think it would be good idea to have single makefile that detects OS and run build.sh and build.bat similarly how it's done for odin compiler

- [ ] I have inspired by Handmade Hero and mr 4th dimension series about platform indepenedt code base so I would like template to include something similar, to avoid unnecessary repetitions when I ocassionally want to start new C project for learning or some prototyping.

- [ ] maybe later on to have some stb libraries
